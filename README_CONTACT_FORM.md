## How It Works

1. **User fills out the contact form** on `contact.php`
2. **Form is submitted** to `enquire.php` via POST method
3. **Data validation** occurs (required fields, email format, etc.)
4. **Email is sent** to `info@evidenthomebuilders.in`
5. **User is redirected** back to `contact.php`
6. **Success/error message** is displayed as an alert
7. **Alert auto-hides** after 5 seconds or can be manually dismissed

## Email Format

The email sent will contain:
- **Subject**: "New Contact Form Submission - Evident Home Builders"
- **Content**:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Service (if selected)
  - Message
  - Submission timestamp
  - IP address

## Security Features

- **Email Headers**: Proper email headers to prevent spam
- **Logging**: Error logging for debugging and monitoring
